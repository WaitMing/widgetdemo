To begin with, it is necessary to determine what a radar is.
We understand that it stores certain data and at least 3 pieces of it.
How it will be visualized is secondary. First you need to decide on the restrictions.

The problem of why you may not be able to visualize may lie precisely in the fact that you do not have a strong foundation in the form of data.

If you familiarize yourself with the radars, it becomes clear that they always have some minimum and maximum values beyond which the data cannot go out (this is an important point in case an error has crept into the data).
